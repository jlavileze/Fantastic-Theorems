These are course notes for PMATH 451 - Measure Theory as offered during the Winter Term of 2019 by Professor Nico Spronk. 
I hope the reader develops as much character as the writer did while taking the course. 

Any errors, lies, or omissions are entirely [Alex Rutar's](https://github.com/alexrutar) fault, not mine.
