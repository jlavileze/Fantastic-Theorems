# MATH 245 - Linear Algebra 2 (Advanced)

The following is the first edition of a set of notes produced during MATH 245 in the Fall of 2017 at the University of
Waterloo. They were produced by combining the proofs provided in the lectures and the supplementary textbook,
Linear Algebra by Friedberg, Insel, and Spence.

In each chapter you will and that I have outlined the essential structure required to pass the course's final
exam. The theorems you will and in the latter part of each chapter are usually exercises from the book which
may be harder to prove off-the-cuff under exam conditions.

Since this is the first edition of such notes, you may find that some of the typos, errors, or jokes, may not be
of your liking. I take full responsibility for the first two; however, if you don't like the jokes, then you have bigger
problems than linear algebra.
